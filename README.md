# Installation

To install, run:

### `npm install`

To run, you will need to open the react app and the server on two seperate terminals.

## Starting react app

### `npm start`

## Starting node/express server

### `cd server`
### `node index.js`


# Notes

The json file is written locally to the server. The user does not receive a response to download the file. This should be an easy fix as you can return a blob for the user to resolve and download the file.
